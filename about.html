      Whose Voice? Whose Story? explores the language of race using the recently digitised collection of 165,000 radio news scripts, produced for the BBC Home Service and its successor, Radio Four.  
Through our Theme Pages/Thematic Collections you can explore the evolution of language used to report on Black and Black-British migration and experience in the UK from 1945 to the early1990s. Our Clapping Back podcasts invite different generations of the public from African and Caribbean backgrounds to speak back to the BBC's reporting.</p>

    <h2> Ethos & Method</h2>
    <p>   
      <div class="abouttextsection">    
      <h3> Ethos</h3>
      The idea for this project was born in the classroom when a student asked the question ‘How does the BBC archive represent Britain’s Black population?’. Several conversations followed since then, which led to this project whose original title is Decolonising the BBC Archive: radio news and the language of race in post –WWII  Britain. <br>
       
      The project brings together two key developments in scholarly research: the debates on Decolonising Education and Research, and the opening up of archives through digitisation projects. We employ decolonising methodologies to explore the BBC news archive and seek to reorientate thinking around the language of race and its uses. This is an archival and public engagement project that aims to reveal the ways in which the broadcaster constructed notions of national belonging in the 20th century and to invite the public to reconfigure and reimagine the BBC's constructions for 21st-century audiences. <br>
       </div>
       
       <h3> Method </h3> 
      We are committed to, and passionate about producing research and creating educational resources that are accessible, inclusive and engage the widest possible audience. This website does not attempt to present a linear history of BBC radio, nor does it claim to offer a comprehensive history of Britain’s population of African and Caribbean background. It instead foregrounds the primary sources and voices we have chosen to represent (ie. news scripts and podcast participants), inviting you to make your own connections and to create your own historical timeline. <br>

      
      And a few more words on the work we’ve done..
      <br>

      
      During the first year of the project we employed historical and discourse analysis to research the BBC news scripts database. Focusing on the period from 1945 to the early 1990s, we explored BBC's coverage of specific events, historical figures and broader themes and terms (e.g. terms such as ‘colour bar’, ‘racism’, ‘anti-racism’, ‘Black Power’). Wherever possible, we have cross-referenced data, using BBC’s own news guides we accessed at the BBC Written Archives, as well as contemporary newsreels, and newspaper databases. <br>

      We read a lot of scripts on several themes and events but we also noticed glaring absences from the news coverage of Home Service/Radio 4. We have given those absences their own place on the website (Radio Silence) 
      as we believe they are equally revealing of the BBC’s editorial choices and approach. 
      
      During the second year of the project we produced our Clapping Back podcasts. Our podcast participants were given a sample of news scripts to read; we recorded their responses to the scripts’ content, language and reporting style. Some participants have lived through the events reported at the time, others know of some of these events from friends and family, or elsewhere. Our aim has been to bring together the voices of the past and present, encouraging different generations to talk with and listen to each other. Clapping back is in the same tradition of 'writing back' or 'talking back' that characterises much of the postcolonial or anti-colonial literature. In this project, the act of 'clapping back' is about recovering and amplifying diverse experiences and different voices.
      <br>
      
      A key concept that has informed our work and this website’s architecture is that of collage, a term used as a qualitative research method in visual arts, education and psychology but also adopted and developed by scholars in Indigenous and Decolonial studies to build alternative governance forms, re-claim and re-occupy spaces and homelands. (Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Decolonising Methodologies: Research and Indigenous peoples, Zed Books, 2021, 3rd edition). 
      Collage as a method and a theory is at the heart of this project, which aims to: 
      <ul>
        <li>
          collate themes around the UK race debate through the study of the language used in BBC radio news scripts
        </li>
        <li>
          put the scripts in dialogue with the public through a series of conversational podcasts.
        </li>

      </ul>
       Both approaches require a process of breaking up, re-ordering and re-arranging the archive in order to create new meanings and access alternative voices.
